## Why Geordi Exists

The web wasn’t built with everyone in mind — and accessibility still relies too much on individual developers “doing the right thing.”  
That’s not sustainable. Accessibility shouldn’t depend on empathy or budget cycles. It should be built into the fabric of how we experience the web.

**Geordi** exists to bridge that gap.

We believe AI can finally make the web usable for *everyone* — by perceiving, understanding, and interacting with web pages the way humans do.  
Instead of waiting for every developer to fix their markup, Geordi interprets what’s on the screen and translates it into an accessible experience.

## Our Mission

> **To make the entire web navigable, understandable, and usable for every human being, regardless of ability or code quality.**

Geordi is an open, community-driven project focused on building AI that:
- Sees and understands interfaces visually — like a person does.  
- Adapts to individual needs (visual, motor, or cognitive).  
- Interacts safely, ethically, and transparently.  
- Works anywhere, without requiring permission from website owners.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility is a right, not a feature.  
Geordi will never gate accessibility behind a paywall, subscription, or proprietary lock-in.

### 2. Transparency over performance.  
Users should *see* what Geordi changes or interprets — not trust a black box.

### 3. Data dignity.  
User data, screenshots, and actions belong to the user. Local-first is the default.

### 4. Respect for the web.  
We augment, not alter. Geordi never breaks underlying site logic or monetization.

### 5. Open collaboration.  
Accessibility experts, disabled users, and developers are all first-class contributors.

## What We’re Building

A browser-based AI that:
1. **Perceives** the visual layout of any website using modern vision-language models.  
2. **Understands** what each element means and does — even without semantic HTML.  
3. **Presents** a consistent, accessible overlay tailored to each user’s preferences.  
4. **Acts** safely on the user’s behalf: clicks, inputs, navigation — always with consent.

We’ll start small: screenshots → element mapping → accessible overlay → user feedback loop.  
Then we’ll grow, together.

## How to Contribute

You don’t need to be an AI researcher to help.  
Accessibility is about empathy, not credentials.

Ways to contribute:
- Testing prototypes and giving feedback.  
- Improving UX for screen readers or switch access.  
- Translating docs or helping with communication.  
- Contributing code for parsing, inference, or UI rendering.  
- Writing tutorials or documentation.  

We’ll be building this openly, transparently, and with joy.

## License & Ethos

Geordi will remain **open source forever** under a permissive license (Apache 2.0 or MPL 2.0 TBD).  
Accessibility should not be owned — it should be shared.

## Our Promise

Geordi will always stand for one simple idea:

> **A world where a disability doesn’t mean “you can’t.”**

And if that takes every one of us — engineers, artists, accessibility experts, and dreamers — then that’s exactly who this project is for.
